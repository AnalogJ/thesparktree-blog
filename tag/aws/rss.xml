	  <title>Drawbridge - SSH Config management for Jump/Bastion hosts</title>

	     <p>In our architecture we have many environments (test/stage/prod/etc), and each environment can have one or more shards, usually broken up by datacenter/avaliablity zone (us-east-1, us-west-2, etc). Each of our shards are protected by Jump/Bastion hosts, auditing and restricting SSH access to internal components.</p>

<p>For ease of use, tunneling into bastion host protected stacks is usually done by adding entries into your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~/.ssh/config</code> file, however when you start adding dozens of entries, it can be confusing and time consuming.</p>

<p>A while back I made a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/8aasuw/tools_for_interacting_withmaintaining_configs_for/">/r/devops</a> asking for help finding a tool that would manage/generate ssh config files for all our jump/bastion hosts.</p>

<p>There was some interest (and great discussion), however no-one submitted a tool that solved the actual problem.</p>

<p>Since that post, I’ve worked on an open source tool that implents everything required to work with Bastion/Jump hosts efficiently as a Developer or member of Operations. Its available now on github: <a href="https://github.com/AnalogJ/drawbridge">Drawbridge</a></p>

<h2 id="here-are-some-of-its-features">Here are some of its features:</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Single binary (available for macOS and linux), only depends on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssh-agent</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scp</code></li>
  <li>Uses customizable templates to ensure that Drawbridge can be used by any organization, in any configuraton</li>
  <li>Helps organize your SSH config files and PEM files</li>
  <li>Generates SSH Config files for your servers spread across multiple environments and stacks.
    <ul>
      <li>multiple ssh users/keypairs</li>
      <li>multiple environments</li>
      <li>multiple stacks per environment</li>
      <li>etc..</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Can be used to SSH directly into an internal node, routing though bastion, leveraging SSH-Agent</li>
  <li>Able to download files from internal hosts (through the jump/bastion host) using SCP syntax</li>
  <li>Supports HTTP proxy to access internal stack urls.</li>
  <li>Lists all managed config files in a heirarchy that makes sense to your organization</li>
  <li>Custom templated files can be automatically generated when a new SSH config is created.
    <ul>
      <li>eg. Chef knife.rb configs, Pac/Proxy files, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Cleanup utility is built-in</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drawbridge update</code> lets you update the binary inplace.</li>
  <li>Pretty colors. The CLI is all colorized to make it easy to skim for errors/warnings</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>You can read more &amp; download it from Github [https://github.com/AnalogJ/drawbridge]</p>

<p>I’m always open to PR’s and feature requests. I’d also love to hear any feedback you guys may have</p>

	  <title>Custom Domains for AWS Lambda/API Gateway using Letsencrypt</title>
	  <link>/custom-domains-for-aws-lambdaapi-gateway-using</link>
	  <author>Jason Kulatunga</author>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <blockquote>
  <p>AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In general Lambda is well designed and the platform is pretty developer friendly, especially if you use a framework like <a href="https://github.com/serverless/serverless">serverless</a> or <a href="https://github.com/apex/apex">apex</a>. However as someone who creates new services on Lambda all the time, there is one thing that consistently annoys me.</p>

<p><strong>Configuring a custom domain for use with Lambda is stupidly complex for such a common feature.</strong></p>

<p>Here’s the AWS documentation to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-custom-domains.html">use a custom domain with API Gateway</a>. Take a look, I’ll wait.</p>

<p>At first glance the instructions seem somewhat reasonable. For security reasons API Gateway requires SSL for all requests, which means that to use a custom domain, you first need an SSL certificate.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this becomes a problem when you realize that
Letsencrypt HTTP-01 doesn’t work because of the catch-22 requiring you to prove that you own the custom domain before generating certificates. Even worse, AWS’s built-in free certificate service (Certificate Manger) <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36497896/can-i-use-aws-certificate-manager-certificates-for-api-gateway-with-custom-domai">doesn’t yet support API Gateway</a>.</p>

<p>So what’s the solution?</p>

<hr />

<p>I was able to create a nice little script using python which invokes the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">aws-cli</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lukas2511/dehydrated">dehydrated</a> letsencrypt client &amp; <a href="https://github.com/AnalogJ/lexicon">lexicon</a> and does all the steps necessary to add a custom domain to an API Gateway, automatically.</p>

<p>Here’s what it does:</p>

<ul>
  <li>validates that all the correct credentials &amp; environmental variables are set</li>
  <li>validates that the specified AWS API Gateway exists</li>
  <li>generate a new set of letsencrypt certificates for the specified custom domain using the DNS-01 challenge &amp; lexicon</li>
  <li>register custom domain name with AWS (which creates a distribution domain name on cloudfront)</li>
  <li>adds a CNAME dns record mapping your custom domain to the AWS distribution domain</li>
  <li>maps the custom domain to your selected API Gateway</li>
</ul>

<p>The code is all open source and lives here: <a href="https://github.com/AnalogJ/aws-api-gateway-letsencrypt/blob/master/api-gateway-custom-domain.py">Analogj/aws-api-gateway-letsencrypt</a></p>

<div class="github-widget" data-repo="AnalogJ/aws-api-gateway-letsencrypt"></div>

<p>I’ve also created a simple <a href="https://github.com/AnalogJ/aws-api-gateway-letsencrypt/blob/master/Dockerfile">Docker image</a> which you can use if you don’t want to install anything:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>docker run <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nt">-e</span> <span class="nv">LEXICON_CLOUDFLARE_USERNAME</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">***</span> <span class="se">\</span>
