Jason Kulatunga is a Devops & Infrastructure guy @Gusto (ex-Adobe).

I design/architect Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment workflows, Configuration Management & Infrastructure-as-Code toolchains and Deployment Orchestration pipelines.

I write about, and play with, all sorts of new tech. All opinions are my own.
