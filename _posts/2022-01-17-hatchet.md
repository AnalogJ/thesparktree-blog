I got frustrated with the amount of daily spam in my Gmail "Promotions" tab -- especially since it made searching for 
email basically impossible. While there are services that will help me unsubscribe from all the mailing lists I'm signed 
up to, they wanted unfettered access to my Google account, which I would never give.

I wrote an open source tool called [hatchet](https://github.com/AnalogJ/hatchet) which will access your Gmail account 
using IMAP, find the latest unsubscribe link for each unique email sender, and write it all to a csv/spreadsheet file.

It's open source and doesn't require any external service.
