**What I did**
So here are the steps that I took in order to get everything working. Quite a few steps but I wanted it detailed enough so that anyone could follow.

- Right click the Dropbox icon in your system tray and select Preferences
- Deselect Show desktop notifications
- Deselect Start Dropbox on system startup
- Download and install Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools. It will warn you about incompatibility, but you can safely ignore this (or at least I did).
- Open the Command Console (Run –&gt; cmd).
- Enter sc create DropboxService binPath= C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Resource Kits\Tools\srvany.exe DisplayName= "Dropbox Service"
- Open RegEdit and navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DropboxService\
- Create a new key named Parameters
- Create a string value called Application and enter the full path to your Dropbox executable. Typically C:\Users\****\AppData\Roaming\Dropbox\bin\Dropbox.exe
- Open Services (Start Menu –&gt; Administrative Tools –&gt; Services)
- Locate your Dropbox Service, right click and select properties.
- Set the service to Autostart
- Under the Log on tab, check Allow service to interact with desktop.
- Press Apply
- Start the service
- You will get a popup asking for permissions to display the Dropbox configuration - Accept.
- Add your user info

Done!
