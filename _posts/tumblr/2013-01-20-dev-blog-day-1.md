Having jumped back and forth between Coderwall and the QuietThyme blog, I’ve found that sometimes the content I want to talk about just doesn’t fit in. So I’ve created this blog on my personal site. Its mostly going to have developer related posts, but there might be a few oddball personal ones in here as well.
