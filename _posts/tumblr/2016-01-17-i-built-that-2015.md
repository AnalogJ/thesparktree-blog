Its 2016 now, and like many others, I thought it would be a good idea to review my accomplisments in the last year. Like most devs, I find myself scratching that itch to build by hacking on side projects in my free time.

After looking though my projects in the last year, it's pretty obvious that I'm missing on the follow-through to completion, and I __HATE__ doing documentation. Both flaws I'll have to focus on in the new year.

This is a list of open source projects that I worked on in 2015.

# Bandit.io

[Bandit.io](https://www.bandit.io) is a Docker based man-in-the-middle proxy + website that lets you debug all http and https requests and responses on remote devices. Its basically like Charles and Fiddler, but without requiring the debugged device to be on the local network. Its also built ontop of the Chrome Remote Debugging Protocol, meaning the ui looks like the Chrome developer tools.

# MediaDepot

[MediaDepot](https://github.com/mediadepot) is Docker based self-hosted media server with the following capabilities:

2. Media server applications such as plex, sickbeard, couchpotato, etc to manage and view media
3. Utility applications such as ajenti, openvpn, conky, btsync, bittorrent, vnc.
4. Notifications system (so that you are notified whenever any service stops or starts, and when media is added)

- __Language__: Docker + Chef
- __Status__: Incomplete
